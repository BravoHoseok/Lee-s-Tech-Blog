## Definition
* <b>Private Key</b>: The private key, also known as a secret key, is a variable in cryptography that is used with an algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data. Secret keys should only be shared with the key generator or parties authorized to decrypt the data. Private keys play an important role in symmetric cryptography, asymmetric cryptography and cryptocurrencies.
* <b>Public Key</b>: The public key is generated by the private key that is fed into Trapdoor function (e.g., elliptical curve), which means that Priave and Public Key are pair.

## Example of Private and Public Key Relationship
For better understanding, Let's take a look at a famous example. The two keys shall not be separated in asymmetric cryptography. In other word, they have relationship!

{: .highlight }
Bob wants to send Alice an encrypted email. To do this, Bob takes Alice’s public key and encrypts his message to her. Then, when Alice receives the message, she takes the private key that is known only to her in order to decrypt the message from Bob. Although attackers might try to compromise the server and read the message, they will be unable to because they lack the private key to decrypt the message. Only Alice will be able to decrypt the message as she is the only one with the private key. And, when Alice wants to reply, she simply repeats the process, encrypting her message to Bob using Bob’s public key.

## Deep Dive
1. <b>Random Number</b>
    * Before diving into private key, we need to look at the meaning of Random Number, because a private key is generated based on randomness.
    * As definition, Random Number is either Pseudo-random or a number generated for, or part of, a set exhibiting statistical <b>randomness</b> in mathematics and statics.
    * Random Number has the following properites
      * <b>_Randomness_:</b> Randomness is the apparent or actual lack of definite pattern or predictability in information. It means that there is no order and does not follow a deterministic pattern. Mote Carlo method is one of the example that relies on random input.
      * <b>_Unpredictability_:</b> whatever someone uses any kind of information or method, no one can predict the next result.
      * <b>_Impossilbe Reconstruction_:</b> Same result shouldn't be represent.
    * Type of Random Number
      * <b>_Deterministic Random Number Generator (DRNG)_:</b> It generates a deterministic random number. 
        * <b>_Pros_</b>
          * No dedicated hardware is required.
          * Implementations can be done in software.
          * Identical seed values imply identical random numbers which is a necessary condition for using them as stream ciphers.
        * <b>_Cons_</b>
          * For pure DRNGs, the output is completely determined by the seed.
          * Output sequences of pure DRNGs cannot be truly independent.
          * They may behave as output sequence of an ideal RNG at most with respect to certain aspects.
          * The internal state has to be protected even if the device is not active.
      * <b>_True Random Number Generator (TRNG)_:</b> It generates Random Number based on a physical process capable of producing entropy. The higher the entropy is, The higer the randomness. Nature provides ample phenomena that generate low-level, statistically random "noise" signals, including thermal and shot noise, jitter and metastability of electronic circuits. So, Hardware Random Number Generator uses this feature to generate TRNG.
      * <b>_Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG)_:</b> It has a modle that minics generating Random Number based on a <b>'deterministic'</b> algorithm. In other word, it tries to imbue randomness property with deterministic algorithm. <b>'Deterministic'</b> means that it needs a specific input to generate a random number. When look at the generation of tons of random number, you may notify a pattern. The seed of PRNG is extracted from TRNG, which means that the input which will be fed into PRNG also has the randomness.
      * <b>_Cryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Number Generator (CSPRNG)_:</b> 
2. <b>Private Key</b>
    * Private key is generated with ’n’ times ‘dot’ operation in ECC, which give randomness property to the private key. The 'n' is also randomly generated integer value. (PRNG).
