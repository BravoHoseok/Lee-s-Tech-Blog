## Deep Dive
Dictionary Attack: A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer, network or other IT resource by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password. A dictionary attack can also be used in an attempt to find the key necessary to decrypt an encrypted message or document. The dictionary attack is similar to Brute Force Attack in a sense. The main difference of the two attack methods is the number of password permutations that are attempted. More details can be found the link below. 

Relay Attack: This attack relays the LF signals from the car over a purpose-built RF link with minimal delays. The link is composed of two parts, the emitter and the receiver. The emitter captures the LF signal and upconverts it to 2.5 GHz. The obtained 2.5 GHz signal is then amplified and transmitted over the air. The receiver part of the link receives this signal and down-converts it to obtain the original LF signal. This LF signal is then amplified again and sent to a loop LF antenna which reproduces the signal that was emitted by the car in its integrity. The procedure for opening and starting the engine of the car remains the same as discussed above. The below picture describes this attack scenario
